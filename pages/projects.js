                                        I helped build many features across the application including the claims display, registration UI, online chat, customer

                                        I lead the development effort to redesign the transfer money experience. I added form validation to the pages that create
                                        and edit money transfers. I refactored the HTML and CSS to be more responsive for mobile devices
                                        such as the iPad. I built an AJAX modal dialog for the user agreement acceptance. I also built an
                                        AJAX dialog for a quick transfer widget. The widget contains a three step wizard to create a one-time
                                        transfer from the user's account details page. Finally, I added a new table to allow the user to
                                        view his or her scheduled transfers when creating a new transfer.

                                        I built a number of enhancements and fixed bugs across their website. I built a jQuery plugin to provide a fixed table header
                                        when scrolling down a large table. The table header plugin is implemented on several pages of the
                                        website including the
                        <a href="https://performance.columbiamanagement.com/web/columbia/products-performance/mutual-funds">

                        Finally, I built a Liferay portlet to provide a web interface for administrators to clear server
                        caches on a single node or across the cluster.

                                        <a href="http://thomsonreuters.com/">Thomson Reuters</a> is a business data provider operating in
                        two divisions: Professional and Markets.

                    </p>
                                    <p>I worked in the professional division on the company's industry leading legal platform: WestlawNext.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <a href="http://www.westlawnext.com">WestlawNext</a> is an online legal research service for professionals
                        and students. Its predecessor, <a href="http://www.westlaw.com">Westlaw</a>, is the market leader
                        for legal research. WestlawNext offers many substantial improvements for users such as a simplified
                        search algorithm, folders for managing research, and an updated user interface.

                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I primarily worked on the document display for WestlawNext. I was one of the first developers on the project which grew to
                                        become one of the largest agile projects in the nation with well over 200 professionals building
                                        the application.

                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I became the primary engineer for several crucial features in WestlawNext. I helped architect an extensive XSLT framework
                                        to produce the XHTML for legal documents. I lead the implementation of document "chunking" to break
                                        large documents into smaller parts. I also helped build the annotations feature that allows users
                                        to highlight sections of documents, and add notes to portions of documents that are relevant to their
                                        research.
